           There are 3 types to add CSS to the Markup                      
           i) Inline CSS                                                
          ii) Internal CSS                                              
         iii) External CSS 

        *Inline CSS is used directly by using style attribute             
        *Internal CSS is used inside the head tags in <style>             
        *External CSS is kept separately inside a .css sheet   
        *Inline CSS takes more precedence then the internal CSS
        *The last change in CSS takes priority
        *To give priority to a change we use !important in it
          e.g.,    <p style="color:red ; background color: gray !important;">
